# Getting started with the Sensorberg SDK

## Demo app

Runing `pod try SensorbergSDK` in a terminal window will open the Sensorberg demo project.
Select the `SBDemoApp` target and run on device.

## Quickstart

### 1. Create an account

To get started with the Sensorberg SDK, [sign up for a free account](https://manage.sensorberg.com/#/signup)
*Read more about our [Beacon Management Platform](https://sensorberg.zendesk.com)*

### 2. Cocoapods

The easiest way to integrate the iOS SDK is via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).
*If you're new to CocoaPods, visit their [getting started documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).*

````
$ cd your-project-directory
$ pod init
$ open -a Xcode Podfile
````

Once you've initialized CocoaPods, just add the [Sensorberg Pod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SensorbergSDK) pod to your target:

````
target 'YourApp' do
	pod "SensorbergSDK", "~> {{ site.latestiOSRelease }}"
end
````

Now you can install the dependencies in your project:

````
$ pod install
$ open <YourProjectName>.xcworkspace
````

### 3. Using the SDK

Import the SensorbergSDK

```
# import <SensorbergSDK/SensorbergSDK.h>
```

Setup the SBManager with an **API key** and a **delegate**
*You can find your API key on the [Beacon Managerment Platform](https://manage.sensorberg.com) in the "Apps" section.
The Sensorberg SDK uses an [event bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) for events dispatching.
During setup, you pass the class instance that will receive the events as the `delegate`.*

```
[[SBManager sharedManager] setApiKey:<api> delegate:self];
```

Before starting the scanner, we need to ask permission to use the Location services.
If you want to receive events while the app is innactive, you need to pass `YES` to the `requestLocationAuthorization`. If you pass `NO`, the app will receive events only when active.

```
[SBManager sharedManager] requestLocationAuthorization:YES];
```
**Important**: Be sure to add the `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` (or `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`) key to your plist file and the corresponding string to explain to the user why the app requires access to location.

To start the scanner, simply call `[[SBManager sharedManager] startMonitoring]`.

Then simply **SUBSCRIBE** to the events you want to receive, like *SBEventPerformAction*, *SBeventRegionEnter* etc

```
SUBSCRIBE(SBEventPerformAction) {
	// here you can access the event object which will contain the action to be performed
}
```
Check out the [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SensorbergSDK/) for a list of all supported protocols.
To receive events in other class instances besides the **delegate** call the `REGISTER()` macro and `SUBSCRIBE` to events.


## Documentation
Documentation is available on [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SensorbergSDK).


## Dependencies

The **Sensorberg SDK {{ site.latestiOSRelease }} requires iOS 8.0** and uses:

- [tolo](https://github.com/genzeb/tolo) for event communication
- [JSONModel](https://github.com/icanzilb/JSONModel) for JSON parsing
- [UICKeyChainStore](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/UICKeyChainStore) for keychain access
